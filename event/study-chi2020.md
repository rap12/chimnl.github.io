            <p>This year, the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems accepted 762 papers to be part of its main program. As a local post-conference event, we will be presenting short overviews of the papers to get a quick view of the latest works in HCI. This event was inspired by the annual CHI Study Group organized by the SIGCHI Japan Chapter.

            <p>HCI is a very diverse field and it is steadily growing in terms of the number of exceptional contributions and the emergence of new lines of research. For example in 2021, a growing number of contributions in critical computing and computational interaction led to the creation of new subcommittees in the conference. The study group aims to quickly get an overview of the new HCI research contributions published at the premier HCI conference. After this event, we hope that the participants can identify topics and problems that they are interested in and start new research projects.</p>
            <p>We also invited Filipino researchers who have accepted papers at CHI 2020. We will have <a href="https://www.gierad.com/" target="_blank">Gierad Laput</a> from Apple as our Keynote speaker and <a href="https://www.bsolgado.com/" target="_blank">Benedict Olgado</a> from UC Irvine for an invited talk about his recent work.</p>
            <p>In 2021, the CHI conference will be held in Japan for the first time. We hope that this event can inspire the Filipino HCI community to work on exceptional submissions.</p>

        <h4 class = "mt-4">How do I participate?</h4>
        <p>People who would like to present CHI papers must do the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://forms.gle/MXZXFpr5pyA6v8No6" target="_blank">Register</a> as a presenter by July 11 (F). We will use the details from your registration to send the links to the Zoom meeting. </li>
            <li>Identify the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aqK7i3pdSCKhvsVvy1z5LxCx-zN3b091ZnMBjm688YE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">sessions</a> you would like to present by July 11 (F).</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 class = "mt-4">How do I select a session to present?</h4>
        <p>Please go to the list of CHI2020 sessions and select the sessions you want to read and present papers for. After you have decided, enter your full name (same as the one you used for registration) in the “Presenter” column of your chosen sessions. You can select more than one session if your current schedule and workload allows. This is a first come first serve basis. Please do not overwrite or delete the names of other people.</p>
        <p>Each session has around 5-6 papers and only one person can present for all papers. However, it is up to you if you want to share the reading load with other people.</p>
        <h4 class = "mt-4">There are too many papers in a session! How do I read them all on time?</h4>
        <p>For this study group, we advise you to be strategic in reading multiple papers. We know that you have other things on your plate so we do not expect you to read the papers thoroughly as you would typically do in an extensive literature review. The goal of the study group and presentations is to extract the important aspects and significant contributions of the paper, in order to inspire future projects. </p>
        <h4 class = "mt-4">What do I need to prepare for the presentation?</h4>
        <p>On the day of the study group, presenters will be given a maximum of 1 minute per paper. For example, if you volunteered to present a session with 5 papers, you have a maximum of 5 minutes to present them all. </p>
        <p>Presenters are required to make one slide per paper and consolidate them in one PDF. Please read through the guidelines for preparing the presentation materials.</p>

        <h4 class = "mt-4">Slides per Paper</h4>
        <p>Please make 1 slide per paper. Since you only have a maximum of 1 minute to present each paper, we advise you to focus on providing an effective summary of the main contributions and interesting aspects of the paper. In each slide, we expect to see the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Paper title</li>
            <li>Author & affiliation</li>
